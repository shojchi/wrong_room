# The Wrong Room

**The Wrong Room** is a browser-based, AI-powered interactive dungeon game. It leverages MediaPipe for real-time object detection (using your webcam to find items like apples, cell phones, and wristwatches) and integrates with the Gemini Live API for real-time, dynamic narrative streaming to act as your Dungeon Master.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Gemini API Key**: You will need an active API key from Google AI Studio with access to the Gemini Live API.

## Project Structure
This is a monorepo containing:
- `/frontend`: The React + Vite client app.
- `/backend`: A lightweight Express server for proxying token requests and authenticating with the Gemini Live API safely during local development.

## Local Setup & Running the App

### 1. Configure the Environment Variables
Before running the application, you need to set up the Gemini API key. Add it to the root project directory, which serves as the central configuration point.

1. Create a file named `.env.local` inside the root folder:
```bash
touch .env.local
```

2. Add your Gemini API key to `.env.local`:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 2. Start the Backend Server
The backend provides a local token proxy to abstract the API key from the frontend during development.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The backend will run at `http://localhost:3001` and provide your frontend with access to the Gemini API key through the local proxy.

### 3. Start the Frontend Application
Leave the backend running and open a new terminal window or tab.

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development environment:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The React app will launch, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 4. Play the Game
- Ensure your browser has permission to access your webcam.
- Once loaded, follow the on-screen instructions to get started. The Dungeon Master will wait for you to scan a real-life artifact using your camera before beginning the multi-challenge narrative!

## Core Technologies

- **React + Vite**: Chosen for lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a highly responsive development experience.
- **MediaPipe (Tasks Vision)**: Enables on-device, real-time object detection. This allows the game to "see" your physical artifacts via the webcam with minimal latency and maximum privacy.
- **Gemini Live API**: Powering the Dungeon Master. We use the WebSocket-based Multimodal Live API to provide real-time audio and text narrative, creating a truly interactive and conversational storytelling loop.
- **Framer Motion**: Used to create a premium, "magical" feel through smooth transitions and complex UI animations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allowed us to build a sophisticated, dark-mode-first design system rapidly.
- **Express (Node.js)**: Acts as a lightweight bridge for secure token management and local development proxying.

**Note on Vercel Deployment:** The app contains configurations (`vercel.json`) set up for easy deployment. In production, provide the `GEMINI_API_KEY` directly via the environment variables dashboard in Vercel.
